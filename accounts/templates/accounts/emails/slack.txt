Dear {{ user.name }},

During the conference we use Slack as both as the official communication tool
for announcements from the conference committee as well as allowing attendees
to socialise with one another.

We always have a friendly and helpful atmosphere on Slack, mirroring the tone
of the conference itself.

You can also get in touch with us - just look for people with the red snake
icon next to their name.

We'd love you to join us, which you can do using the signup link below:

Please remember that our code of conduct applies equally to Slack.

We look forward to seeing you in Cardiff!
