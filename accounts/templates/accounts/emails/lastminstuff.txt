Dear {{ user.name }},

PyCon UK 2018 starts tomorrow. Here are some last-minute information and instructions for you.

Please check the conference schedule https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/, and make sure that you
know when and where your talk is.

The schedule won't change now without a very good reason, and if we do have to move your session,
we'll let you know.

When you give your talk there will be a session chair who will introduce you, help you keep to
time, and help you with questions (if you choose to take them). For workshops one of the team will
help you get set up and will check in from time to time.

Unless the schedule says otherwise will have twenty five minutes for your session, which may
include questions if you would like to take them.

We will be filming almost all the talks, and will put the videos online. If you do not want your
talk to be filmed, please let us know in advance.

We have an array of adaptors to connect to the projectors and screens. The projector in the
Assembly Room is widescreen; others may be widescreen or 4:3.

If you are speaking in the Assembly Room: your session will have live captions, provided by our
STTR team, Sheryll, Mirella and Hilary.

You can help them, and improve the captions and the transcript, by alerting them in advance to
terms that might not be immediately obvious.

Please do that by creating a page for your Assembly Room session at
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HOMochIhTUXG43tFuxE8GcclWh3cutKZqtv6Wgi8MmM/edit#.

Room 136 (downstairs) is our speaker preparation room ("Green room"). Please make use of it if you
need somewhere to prepare.

Thank you, on behalf of the whole Python community in the UK, for the work you're doing to make the
conference a success.
