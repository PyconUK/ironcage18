Dear {{ proposal.proposer.name }},

We noticed that we had accepted your proposal {{ proposal.title }} ({{ proposal.get_session_type_display }})
for PyCon UK 2018, {% if proposal.state == 'confirm' %}and you have confirmed that you will present it {% endif %}but you do not appear to have a ticket.

This is fine, we just want to check that you are still expecting to present your session, and that you are
aware that all attendees to PyCon UK need to have a ticket regardless of whether they are contributors or not.

You can check the schedule to find out which date you are presenting here: https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/.
Please be aware that sessions will remain on the same day, but may move time and room.

{% if proposal.proposer.grant_application and proposal.proposer.grant_application.ticket_awarded %}
As you applied for financial assistance, you should have received a ticket invitation by email.
If you have misplaced this email or are having trouble with your invitation, please reply and let us know.
{% endif %}

It's possible you have two accounts - we think we've found and resolved all these cases, but please reply and
let us know if you think this is the case.

If you're not available on the date your proposal is currently scheduled, please let us know and we will try
and resolve the situation.

Lastly, if you've decided not to present at PyCon UK 2018, we would appreciate if you could let us know so
that we can finalise our schedule.

We look forward to seeing you in Cardiff!
