Dear {{ proposal.proposer.name }},

Thanks for your submission to our call for proposals, {{ proposal.title }} ({{ proposal.get_session_type_display }}).

I’m delighted to inform you that we have selected this proposal for our programme.

As usual, we have received far more proposals than we can possibly accept, and
choosing the right proposals for our programme has been very difficult.
{% if user_proposal_count > 1 %}
If you have submitted other proposals, you’ll be hearing from us about them in the
coming days. The same goes for any application you have made for financial assistance.
{% endif %}

We’d like you to confirm that you will be able to attend and present this session by

With best regards,
