Dear {{ proposal.proposer.name }},

We're looking forward to seeing you in Cardiff later this month!

There's a full schedule for the conference on our website: https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/

This is based on availability information people have sent us. If you can't make
your assigned slot, please tell us immediately, and we can try to find an
alternative time. If you're no longer able to give your session, please tell us.

If you're presenting with additional speakers, please make sure they have their
own ticket. Everybody who attends the conference needs a ticket, including
organisers and speakers. Please also check their names are spelt correctly in the
schedule â€“ email us if you need a correction.

We'll provide more information about rooms, chairs, and A/V closer to the conference.

All the best,

~ The PyCon UK Committee
