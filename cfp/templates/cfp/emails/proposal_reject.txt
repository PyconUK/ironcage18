Dear {{ proposal.proposer.name }},

Thanks for your submission to our call for proposals, {{ proposal.title }} ({{ proposal.get_session_type_display }}),
and for your patience as we assessed all the proposals.

I’m sorry to inform you that we have not selected this proposal for our programme.

As usual, we have received far more proposals than we can possibly accept, and have
been obliged to decline many fine submissions. It’s not just a matter of choosing
the ‘best’ proposals; we’ve also selected proposals to give us a good balance of topics,
levels of expertise, speaker backgrounds and more.

Selecting proposals for our programme is one of the hardest parts of running PyCon UK,
and we’ve had to decline many excellent ones with great regret.
{% if user_proposal_count > 1 %}
If you have submitted other proposals, you’ll be hearing from us about them in the coming days.
The same goes for any application you have made for financial assistance.
{% endif %}
Thanks once again for taking the time and effort to propose a session for the event.

With best regards,

The PyCon UK 2018 programme selection team.
