Dear {{ user.name }},

PyCon UK is but a week away, and we hope you're as excited as we are! We just
wanted to cover some administrative items before the conference. Later in the
week we’ll let you know about our dinner and evening social events.

Firstly - please bring your ticket! You will need the QR code shown on the
tickets page (click "View your conference ticket" at https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/)
or attached to this email to collect your badge. You can bring this either
electronically or on paper.

Secondly, please can we invite you to update your profile on our site. Aside
from helping us understand the demographics of the conference and design your
highly sought after badge, it's the only way to let us know of accessibility and
dietary requirements and book a space in the crèche.
You can update your profile at https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/profile/edit/

If you've not seen our schedule, then please take a look! You can also download
either full or personalised iCal files to keep the schedule on your device. You
can find it at https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/.

A quick note on travel arrangements - parking is not available at the venue
except for a limited number of disabled spaces. If you need one of these, please
reply to this email letting us know your registration number so we can pass it
to Cardiff City Hall security.

We look forward to seeing you in Cardiff on the 15th!
