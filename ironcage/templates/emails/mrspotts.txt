Dear {{ user.name }},

We've been able to reserve a block of rooms and beds at the Mrs Potts hostel in Cardiff, exclusively for PyCon UK attendees http://mrspottsbackpackers.co.uk. The hostel is in the centre of Cardiff and very convenient for the conference.

You are being offered the first chance to secure this accommodation.

The accommodation is in four-bed and six-bed dormitories. The dormitories are secure, clean and comfortable. Last year, 62 of our attendees stayed at the Mrs Potts hostel, and we had extremely good reports.

Rates are £25 for Friday and Saturday nights, and £15 for all other nights - you won't find a better deal for your conference accommodation.

You'll be able to specify your preferences for a male/female dormitory when you book, or you can book an entire room for a group of friends.

To book, please email Mrs Potts <info@mrspottsbackpackers.co.uk>, and mention that you are attending PyCon UK. Lucy and Jess are our friendly contacts at the hostel, and they will be able to help you.

You will need to do this as soon as possible - in a few days we will make this information public on the website, and we expect all the available places to go very quickly.

With regards,

The PyCon UK 2018 team
