Hello to all,

PyCon UK 2018 has been wrapped up, everything is back in storage, and the snakes
are hibernating for another year.

As we do after every conference, we'd like to ask that you give us some feedback.
This helps us improve the conference year after year, and it is much appreciated.
Below is a link to the form, and thank you in advance for taking the time to fill it out.

Many thanks,
PyCon UK Organisers
