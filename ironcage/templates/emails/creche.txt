If your child is old enough to have meals and refreshments with us, they are
welcome to join us. If they are not, you will need to provide their food.
You will also need to provide nappies and other required items. Toys will be provided,
but of course your child may bring some favourites of their own.

We look forward to seeing you in Cardiff!
