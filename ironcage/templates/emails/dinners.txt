Dear {{ user.name }},

It is now just over a week to the start of the event.

Tickets are now on sale for the Grand Conference Dinner on Saturday 15th September.
These always sell out, so order yours now to avoid disappointment: https://2018.pyconuk.org/evening-events/grand-conference-dinner/.

So that you don't need to wander the streets of Cardiff in search of an excellent
meal and enjoyable company, we've arranged additional dinners for every night of
the event, at one of Cardiff's best restaurants, The Clink: https://2018.pyconuk.org/evening-events/dinners-clink/.

All the conference dinners are offered to you at cost price or less - they are excellent value.

{% if user.is_contributor %}
To thank you for your contribution to PyCon UK, whether you are a speaker, workshop
organiser or are putting something else into the event, we'd like to offer you a
complimentary ticket to one of the dinners.

To claim your ticket simply go to book a dinner ticket as normal, and at the bottom
of the page you will see a button marked "Claim my complimentary ticket".
You can book further tickets at the normal price after claiming your complimentary one.

We've also arranged other activities for the evenings, and you're warmly invited
to take part in them all.

Sunday night is board games and manual technology night: https://2018.pyconuk.org/evening-events/board-games-and-manual-technology/

On Monday night, there will be a Code Dojo, suitable for all levels of expertise: https://2018.pyconuk.org/evening-events/code-dojo/

And Tuesday night is Python music night: https://2018.pyconuk.org/evening-events/python-music-night/.

There's be a cash bar and a wood-fired pizza oven at City Hall on each of these nights.

Please take this opportunity to check the final details of your tickets and registration.
It will save us a great deal of time if everything is in order for you when you arrive.

With best regards,

The PyCon UK team
