You have not yet registered the PyCon UK ticket allocated to you {{url}}.
If your ticket is no longer required, please contact us immediately to let us know.

You need to do this with urgency. Unless you register this ticket online within
the next few hours, you will not receive a badge for the conference, and your
access to the event itself on the day will be delayed.

If your registration is not completed in time, you may find that meals you require
are not available, and that you are not able to attend the conference dinner.

Access to other conference events and facilities may also be limited.

{% if invite.ticket.free_reason == "Financial Assistance" %}
If you do not claim your ticket within the next 24 hours, it will be withdrawn and
you will not be able to attend the conference.

If you have any questions or problems registering the ticket, please contact us
